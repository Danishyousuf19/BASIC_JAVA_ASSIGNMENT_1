 /*regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the same length and all angles 
have the same degree (i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). The formula for 
computing the area of a regular polygon is
Area = 𝑛 × 𝑆
2
4 ×tan(
𝜋
𝑛
)
Write a method that returns the area of a regular polygon using the following header:
public static double area(int n, double side)/*

public class Q5 {
	public static double area(int n, double side) {
		double areaof= (n*(Math.pow(side, 2)))/(4.0*(Math.tan(Math.PI/n)));
		return areaof;
	}

public static  void main (String args[]) {
	int noofsides=4;double side=2;
	double d=area(noofsides,side);
	System.out.printf("area of polygon of %d sides and each of length %1.3f = %1.3f \n",noofsides,side,d); 
	
	AREA(4,2);
}

 
//void
public static void AREA(int a,double b) {
	double areaof= (a*(Math.pow(b, 2)))/(4.0*(Math.tan(Math.PI/a)));
	System.out.printf("area of polygon of %d sides and each of length %1.3f = %1.3f ",a,b,areaof);
	
}
}
